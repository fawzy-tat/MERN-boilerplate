This is my personal MERN stack boilerplate which speeds up development process.

## Includes the following

## Front-end ( react )

- React-redux setup with boilerplated file structure including ( reducers - actions ) and an example to demonstrate how to use it ( src/pages/ReduxExample.js ) .

- Clean file structure Including ( Pages - Components - functions - services - store - translations - api )

- Clean routing using react-router-dom and Switch

## Back-end ( NodeJs )

- Boilerplated express app with clean file structure includiong ( Config - DB - Modules with controllers and models - Validation - helpers - middlewares - routes )

- Package setup ( Dotenv - axios - CORS - bull )

- Unit test example using Chai and Mocha

## Just run npm i and focus on coding :)
